    "\n",
    "This challenge is broken up into 3 Parts. This notebook will be the final document that you will submit once complete. You should be able to complete the challenge in 3 hours or less. The goals of each part are\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Part 1**: To assess your technical capabilities regarding basic data manipulation.\n",
    "- **Part 2**: To assess your technical capabilities for applying standard machine learning techniques to a simple data set. Keep in mind that a reasonable, working model is better than a novel solution.\n",
    "- **Part 3**: To assess your approach to problem solving and relating machine learning to real world contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand your thinking processes, please elaborate on your methods using concise markdown and/or in-code comments, however avoid commenting on what is self evident from the code. Examples of the types of commentary we are looking for are\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assumptions made about the data\n",
    "- Insights observed from the data set during exploration\n",
    "- Anything you might have done differently or added with more time\n",
    "\n",
    "Add additional cells as needed to arrive at your solutions. While Question 1 should be answered using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), you can use any package you wish for Question 2 - just be sure to provide a `requirements.txt` file with the versions of any additional libraries needed to run the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The notebook should be capable of being run end to end, without error, assuming that the files `township_train.csv` and `township_test.csv` are in the same directory and `pip install -r requirements.txt` has been run.\n"

    "1. `township_train.csv`: Overall historical data on historical properties of townships and the number of townhomes within\n",

    "- `county_index`: anonymized ID corresponding to a particular county\n",
    "- `township_index`: anonymized ID corresponding to a particular township\n",
    "- `median_income`: the median income of the residents in the township\n",
    "- `count_population`: the total number of residents in the township\n",
    "- `count_large_companies`: the total number of companies located  in the township with 200 employees or more\n",
    "- `count_parks`: the total number of public parks in the township\n",
    "- `count_traffic_lights`: the total number of intersections with traffic lights in the township\n",
    "- `municipal_budget`: the quarterly budget of the township\n",
    "- `count_breweries`: the total number of breweries in the township\n",
    "- `schools_per_10000`: the ratio of the number of schools per 10,000 residents in the township\n",
