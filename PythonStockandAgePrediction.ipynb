    "# 1 Python Stock Prediction Project\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Python file, you will be creating a neural network to predict the price of a stock. Part of the program is already implemented, your goal is to set up the model, train the model on the training data set, then finally predict the values from the testing data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the following details you need to implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "You should create a Sequential model with 5 layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your model should use 2 LSTM layers, and after each use a Dropout layer with a rate of 0.2. The first LSTM layer should have input_shape as a parameter along with units set to 4. The final layer should be a Dense layer with units set to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model is set up, you should compile it with a mean_squared_error loss and the optimizer set to adam.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you fit the training dataset, make sure to set the following values: epochs=5, batch_size=16, verbose=0\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you should run the predict function on the x_test dataset and print the last column of the array along with the model summary.\n",

    "Let's dive into this Python Stock Prediction Project with the given starting code. Here's a structured plan to bring this to fruition, ensuring our code is not just a jumble of instructions but a symphony orchestrated with precision and clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reshape x_train and x_test Datasets:\n",
    "First, we must reshape the x_train and x_test datasets to fit the LSTM input requirements. LSTM expects the input to be in a specific format of 3D array \n",

    "We'll craft a Sequential model that adheres to the architecture specified. This includes defining the LSTM layers with the appropriate dropout layers, culminating in a Dense layer for output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compile, Fit, and Predict:\n",
    "After setting up the model, we'll compile it using the 'adam' optimizer and 'mean_squared_error' for the loss. Following this, we fit the model on the training dataset with the specified epochs and batch size. Lastly, we'll predict the stock prices using the x_test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Print Predictions and Model Summary:\n",
    "To conclude, we'll print the last column of the predictions array to display the predicted stock prices and call the model summary for a detailed architectural overview.\n",
